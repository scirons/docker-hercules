# Docker tk4 mvs38j - z/OS ADCD


This runs the [TK4-](http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/) distribution of MVS 3.8J and any z/OS ADCD DASDs inside Docker.


All credit belongs to Juergen Winkelmann for creating TK4-, Volker Bande for creating TK3, the Hercules team for
creating Hercules, IBM for creating MVS and z/OS, etc. - all I did was package it into a Docker container.
